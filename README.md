Sex classification of abalones presents a significant challenge in aquaculture, impacting breeding strategies and population sustainability. To address this, this study uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy of sex classification in abalones which is a crucial task for effective breeding and resource management. We test the efficacy of 18 different algorithms in differentiating between male, female, and infant abalones using a diverse range of abalone curated from the UCI machine learning repository dataset. This dataset has 8 physical features from number of rings to length. The models are trained and evaluated to assess their predictive classification power. The models demonstrate a promising foundation for classification with an overall accuracy of 56%. While initial performance shows rooms for improvement, a high precision and recall for the infant class highlights its effectiveness in certain categories. Furthermore, by providing feature importance rankings and a visual representation of the decision-making process, the study provides essential information that paves the way for further optimisation. This study advances the field of marine aquaculture by providing a sophisticated, data-driven method for sex
